This code is our (Michael Chiang and Alan Du) adaptation of the techniques used 
in the paper, Winning Daily Fantasy Hockey Contests Using Integer Programming by

GLPK is an open-source solver, and additionally Cbc is an open-source solver. This code uses GLPK
because we found that it was slightly faster than Cbc in practice. For those that want to build
very sophisticated models, they can buy Gurobi. To install GLPKMathProgInterface, simply run
Pkg.add("GLPKMathProgInterface")
