1. covariance_mat
Computed pairwise covariance between all players. Removed player pairs that didn’t play in at least 40% of games.

2. covariance_mat_test
Same as covariance_mat but also spiked covariances of “good” player pairs by a factor of 1.25. Defined “good” as player pairs that had at least 2 increases in covariance that were above the 75th percentile of changes in covariance among all player pairs up to the current date.

3. covariance_mat_chg75p_spike
Same as covariance_mat_test but defined “good” as player pairs that had at least max(2, round(sum(cov_time_chg[i,] != 0, na.rm = T)*0.20)) increases in covariance that were above the 75th percentile of changes.

4. covariance_mat_chg75p_exp(spike)
Same as covariance_mat_75p_spike but spiked covariances of “good” player pairs by a factor of 1+exp(-scaled_covariance)*0.25, where scaled_covariance is the covariance of “good” player pairs scaled to between 0 and 1 using function(x){(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))} (x is the covariances of the “good” player pairs).

Feasibility
Formulation 2
Formulation 3

5. covariance_mat_chg75p_zeros
Same as covariance_mat_75p_spike but set non-“good” player pair covariances to 0 instead of increasing the “good” player pairs by factor of 1.25. Note that variances are still the same.

6. covariance_mat_arima_p3d1q2
ARIMA model with p = 3, d = 1, q = 2. Covariances of pairs that played < 33% of games set to 0. When ARIMA does not coverage, set prediction to average of previous 3 games.

Feasibility
Formulation 2 (running)
Formulation 3

TODO:
- ARIMA but only for the “good” pairs?
- moving average, Kalman filter? Goal is to find upward trending pairs
